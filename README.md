# Trading View Wallpaper

The Trading View Wallpaper is an `.html` page using a trading view widget and a set crypto watchlist with versions pairing the crypto to both CAD and USD markets.
**tradingview-wpe** was designed and intented for use with Wallpaper Engine.

**⚠️ Note:** Though setting the `.html` page as your wallpaper could work, your mileage may vary and isn't support by the author.
